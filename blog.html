    <li class=" text-center text-sky-600 font-semibold  bg--700 text-3xl py-5">1) What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</li>
    <p class="text-gray-800 font-medium block text-xl text-center py-2 mx-20">DOM or Document Object Model is an API (Application programming interface) that defines a logical layout of content & how it’s accessed and manipulated. Using DOM, programmers can build, construct, add, modify, delete, or navigate elements or contents. Everything present on an HTML webpage can be edited using DOM. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="text-gray-800 font-medium block text-xl text-center py-2 mx-20">The purpose of the Dom is to manipulate data using javascript</p>
    <li class=" text-center text-sky-600 font-semibold  bg--700 text-3xl py-5" > 2) How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.
     <p class="text-gray-800 font-medium block text-xl text-center py-2 mx-20">We can Select HTML elements by by using some dom properties and also Everything that makes up your DOM is more generically known as nodes.
        WE can get every element by using node list but there are several ways to get HTML elements using the Document Object Model (DOM). The most commonly used methods include getElementById(), getElementsByTagName(), getElementsByName(), querySelector(), and querySelectorAll()
     </p class="text-gray-800 font-medium block text-xl text-center py-2 mx-20">   
    </li>
    <li class=" text-center text-sky-600 font-semibold  bg--700 text-3xl py-5"> 3) What is event bubble?</li>
    <p class="text-gray-800 font-medium block text-xl text-center py-2 mx-20"> Event bubbles are  event-driven programming concept where there are bunch of events in a position and executed in the order they are received. They are a simple way of organizing and executing events in a sequence.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="text-gray-800 font-medium block text-xl text-center py-2 mx-20">We can keep  track of a  user-triggered  events by Event bubble, such as mouse clicks, key presses, and other interactions which occur with a user interface.  Event bubbles can allow for efficient use of resources and provide a more organized way of executing tasks.Event  bubbles are useful for asynchronous tasks, such as network communication, queuing tasks, and dealing with system resources.</p>
    <li class=" text-center text-sky-600 font-semibold  bg--700 text-3xl py-5"> 4) What is a callback function and why will you use it?</li>
    <p class="text-gray-800 font-medium block text-xl text-center py-2 mx-20"> A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, to be “called back” at a later time. A function that accepts other functions as arguments is called a higher-order function, which contains the logic for when the callback function gets executed. It’s the combination of these two that allow us to extend our functionality.

        Callback functions can be synchronous or asynchronous. The callback function as the name implies is the function that gets executed after the other function has finished executing. A callback is a function that is passed as a parameter into another function to be executed later to perform some operation. The callback function is executed asynchronously.</p>
